# FINE3300-Mortgage-Payments
The associated Python script serves as a mortgage payment calculator, returning six different payment options available to borrowers. These options are monthly, semi-monthly, bi-weekly, weekly, accelerated (rapid) bi-weekly, and accelerated (rapid) weekly payments. This calculator requests user input for three parameters (principal, rate, and amortization), determines the periodic rate corresponding with each payment option, and calculates the six aforementioned payment values using the present value of an annuity equation.
