# FINE3300-Mortgage-Payments
FINE3300 - Assignment 1 Submission - Jonathan Gieb

The associated Python script serves as a mortgage payment calculator, returning six different payment options. These are monthly payments, semi-monthly payments, bi-weekly payments, accerated bi-weekly payments, weekly payments, and accelerated weekly payments. This calculator requests user input for three parameters (principal, rate, and amortization), determines the periodic rate corresponding with each payment option, and calculates the six payment values.
